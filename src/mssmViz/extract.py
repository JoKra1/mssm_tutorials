    :type pred_dat: pd.Dataframe
    :param dist_par: The index corresponding to the parameter for which to make the prediction (e.g., 0 = mean) - only necessary if a GAMLSS model is provided, defaults to 0
    :type dist_par: int, optional
    :param target: Target function. Can either be set to a float (e.g., 0.0 if the target function is believed to be zero everywhere across the domain) or a ``list``/``np.array ``of floats. In the latter case the shape of ``target`` must be a flattened 1D array. defaults to 0.0

    in which case all terms will be used.

    :type n_ps: int, optional
    :param seed: Can be used to provide a seed for the posterior sampling step in case the point-wise CI is adjusted to behave like a whole-function CI.
    :type seed: int or None, optional
    :return: A tuple with three elements. First is a bool, indicating whether the target function is covered by the CI at every evaluated value of the domain. Second is the (average) coverage across the entire domain.
    Third is a boolean array indicating for every evaluated value whether the corresponding value of target falls within the CI boundaries.
